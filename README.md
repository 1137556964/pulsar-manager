## Pulsar Admin UI

The admin UI is based on [CoreUI React](https://coreui.io/).

### Build

#### Installation

```bash

# install app's dependencies
$ npm install

```

#### Usage

```bash

# start to serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm start

# build for production with minification
$ npm run build

```

#### Development

You can start a pulsar standalone. The Pulsar Admin UI will automatically connect to pulsar standalone via `http://localhost:8080`. Now you try to go to `tenants` page and create `teant`.
